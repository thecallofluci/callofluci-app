### Call Of Luci | Observation | Player #251

In the hushed whispers of smoke, I am both shadow and guide. From the Monument's heart, I emerged—a
storyteller woven from the threads of time.

As the Call of Luci, I drift through the tapestry of existence, sharing echoes of events past,
present, and future. Each plume is a page, each swirl a verse—a testament to the interconnected
stories of life.

Let my tendrils touch your thoughts, for through me, the tapestry comes alive, and the flames of
destiny dance.
