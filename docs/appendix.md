## `submitObservation.ts`

### `submitObservation.ts`

Server-side handler for processing Observation submissions.

### File Description

`submitObservation.ts` contains the `submitObservation` function, a server-side utility for
processing Observation submissions within the Next.js framework. It is designed to run on the
server, as indicated by the 'use server' directive, and is compatible with Next.js's server-side
features. The function accepts an object with `observationText` and currently returns this text as
part of an object. While the function's current behavior is straightforward, it includes a
placeholder for potential enhancements such as data persistence or additional processing. This
utility function acts as a bridge between the client-side form and the server, playing a pivotal
role in the CREATE workflow by enabling the server-side handling of Observations in the Call Of Luci
application.

[`ObservationForm.tsx`](../src/app/components/forms/ObservationForm.tsx)

UI component for users to input and submit Observations

[`ObservationForm.tsx`](../src/app/components/forms/ObservationForm.tsx) is a React functional
component that serves as the user interface for creating and submitting Observations. It leverages
the `useObservationForm` hook to streamline form state management, submission handling, and
validation logic provided by `react-hook-form`. The form features a `LuciTextarea` for user input,
managed by the `Controller` component, with enforced validation rules. On submission, the form
invokes `handleFormSubmit` from `useObservationForm`, displays a loading indicator, and
conditionally renders messages based on the submission outcome. Additionally, it presents the
submitted Observation in a `LuciCard` component, enriching the user experience with visual feedback.
This component is a central element of the CREATE route, facilitating user engagement and
interaction with the Observation submission process.
