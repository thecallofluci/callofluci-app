ObservationForm.tsx

UI component for users to input and submit Observations

ObservationForm.tsx is a React functional component that serves as the user interface for creating and submitting Observations. It leverages the useObservationForm hook to streamline form state management, submission handling, and validation logic provided by react-hook-form. The form features a LuciTextarea for user input, managed by the Controller component, with enforced validation rules. On submission, the form invokes handleFormSubmit from useObservationForm, displays a loading indicator, and conditionally renders messages based on the submission outcome. Additionally, it presents the submitted Observation in a LuciCard component, enriching the user experience with visual feedback. This component is a central element of the CREATE route, facilitating user engagement and interaction with the Observation submission process.

`submitObservation.ts`

Server-side handler for processing Observation submissions.

`submitObservation.ts` contains the `submitObservation` function, a server-side utility for processing Observation submissions within the Next.js framework. It is designed to run on the server, as indicated by the 'use server' directive, and is compatible with Next.js's server-side features. The function accepts an object with `observationText` and currently returns this text as part of an object. While the function's current behavior is straightforward, it includes a placeholder for potential enhancements such as data persistence or additional processing. This utility function acts as a bridge between the client-side form and the server, playing a pivotal role in the CREATE workflow by enabling the server-side handling of Observations in the Call Of Luci application.
