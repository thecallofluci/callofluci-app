## `submitObservation.ts`
### Summary
Server-side handler for processing Observation submissions.
### File Description
 `submitObservation.ts` contains the `submitObservation` function, a server-side utility for processing Observation submissions within the Next.js framework. It is designed to run on the server, as indicated by the 'use server' directive, and is compatible with Next.js's server-side features. The function accepts an object with `observationText` and currently returns this text as part of an object. While the function's current behavior is straightforward, it includes a placeholder for potential enhancements such as data persistence or additional processing. This utility function acts as a bridge between the client-side form and the server, playing a pivotal role in the CREATE workflow by enabling the server-side handling of Observations in the Call Of Luci application.
